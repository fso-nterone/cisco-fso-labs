# LAB SETUP

This lab demonstrates simple integration with a variety of common APIs that perform standard operational standard stack functions:
vault & artifactory placeholder- lastpass
kubernetes - ci tool
kubernetes - sample java apps
aws - cloud provider
python, shell, bash
docker
Appdynamics
ThousandEyes
github/gitlab
cisco csr1000v
IOX XE

Instructors of this lab should have:
Intermediate hands on skills with the following:
git branching and github/gitlab - managing repos and branches, understand git flow and developer processes using git to rapidly iterate on code
advanced json and yaml file format understanding
advanced cisco networking
advanced docker
advanced aws and cloud networking
Advanced knowledge and experience with SDLC, rapid iteration and current develops rapid iteration concepts
Green/Red rapid iteration development cycle and code testing concepts
The importance of ensuring all cloud based infrastructure is managed as code - Infra as Code

Students of this lab require at least basic experience and skills with:
git flow, creating branches, updating code etc.
ssh keys - generating and using
linux command line, shell, bash
basic python
basic docker

Once vetted, the repo will be made public so this is only temporary during the beta testing of the lab

1. Clone the git repo
https://github.com/devops-ontap/cisco-fso-labs

2. Create a Branch - each lab user will create their own branch
- in this lab we will not doing a git merge. people will work from their own branches
- git checkout -b yourname
- git status
- git fetch --all

Do a first commit by 1. creating a notes file then do:
git add mynotes.txt
git commit -m "added notes file for first commit"
git push --set-upstream origin yourbranchname
git pull
git fetch -all

Check you are on your branch
git branch




3. Setup your IAM account with Admin/FullEC2 and ability to generate VPCs and add the key in lastpass vault secure note
    - In this lab - using lastpass as it is free and fast/simple to set up an account. Add the key to lastpass in a note in the AWS csv format
    - we will be using lastpass as our vault for now. Subsequent iterations will use Hashicorp Vault and AD

4. Login to the ci tool concourse (you will be provided with a credential - the credential is assigned to a Team).
   Everyone in your Team has access to the same pipelines. Access to pipe-lines is by Team.
   download the fly too from http://ci.devops-ontap.com:8080

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo mv ~/Downloads/fly /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/fly

5. From within your git repo directory - update your lab_vars.py file with the name you want to use for your lab. For simplicity, keep the the name the same as your branch name
6. create a params directory outside of the git repo, and copy out the sample-params.yml file into that directory.
7. Update the master pipeline file parameters file with your branch name
8. Update the params file with your branch name(same as lab name) and your git SSH private key and email address (the git credentials are only required when the lab repo is private)

Please note, in AWS the AMI names for images are different per region - so prior to entering in the AMI code - you must discover what it is for the region you want to provision your lab to
For simplicity, each lab environment is deployed to its own region and az. You can have 4 azs to a region, so you can have 4 isolated labs to a region.
For an instructor wanting each student to have their own lab, they would select 4 regions, each with one az and assign it to each student.

9.
target the ci tool using fly and set your pipeline
example:
Login to a Team
fly -t ci login --concourse-url=http://ci.devops-ontap.com:8080 -n nterone
This command opens a browser, login and then capture the token and paste it into your command prompt

10. set the pipeline and keep the pipeline suffix name the same as your lab name and your branch name for consistency, example:
    fly -t ci set-pipeline -c pipeline-master-v1.yml -p cicsco-fso-lab1 -l ../params/pipeline-params.yml

Update the lab_vars.py file accordingly
git add  lab_vars.py
git commit - "updated lab vars file"
git push

As soon as a git push is done to the branch, the first step in the pipeline
automatically starts. This step:

Grabs the AWS Auth Key from the lastpass vault,
Grabs the resources to be used in the pipeline:
Pulls the docker container and uses it as the pipeline worker container image
Pulls the git branch and dumps it onto the build container
Authenticates to AWS and Creates the SSH key that will be used subsequently to deploy the EC2 images and AWS resources

Start the build of the AWS Env. This will create the resources in the name you set in the vars file:
VPC
Subnets
Route Tables
Routes
Internet Gateway
Security Group
Ingress Rules to allow SSH into lab

Once the Deploy AWS Env job turns green, start the Deploy Cisco CSR1000V job
This job takes the longest, as before much of the code can execute it must wait on the
instance to fully initialize, so there is polling set up in the job.













All configuration in this lab will be done via code - we will only use the GUI to view the changes we make via code. In reality the GUI is not even required
however, we use it only as a visual familiar representation of our changes as it is most familiar to the students in the lab.

The Instructor and the students will be constantly doing git updates throughout the lab to their branch as the Instructure steps them through the lab
This repetition, will enforce the green/red rapid iteration of code which is an important skill that requires repitition and practise much like playing a musical instrument.

We are not only teaching our students new ways of working with cisco apis, we are teaching them a new modern way of working with network infrastructure as code
in a modern SDLC. This way of working has been used for Software Developers for over 20 years, and by Devops Engineers for over 10 years,  but it is relatively new to Network Administrators.

Traditional on site data centers have established a specific work methodology among the vast population of network administrators - however, due to cloud integrations this way of working no longer can be used
to successfully manage hybrid cloud and cloud networking environments.

To ensure stability of our infrastructure, it is required to manage it via code using the SDLC and Industrial Pipelines.

As soon as a git push is complete, the lab prep job in the pipeline automatically starts






openssl rsa -outform der -in private.pem -out private.key


Common Error when trying to SSH to the CSR1000v:
Unable to negotiate with 18.220.247.107 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

Add the following to the /etc/ssh/ssh_config
KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

To see what is possible with an AWS Cli command run this:
aws ec2 create-vpc --generate-cli-skeleton

BASIC LAB CONFIG
One instance of this pipeline creates a pop up lab in aws that contains:
vpc01 with CIDR 10.10.0.0/16

Create Two Subnets for vpc01:

router
lan - associated to lan subnet and default route goes to the csr1000v so all traffic going out of AWS passes through our router
internet gateway
default route table for vpc has 0.0.0.0/0 to destination our internet gateway

Creates a Security Group in the az and region that has an ingress allowing inbound on port 22
to enable the lab users to SSH to the instances that are provisioned

Creates an SSH key - one for each instance of the lab

---------

After the LAB BASE is deployed, the FSO stack is deployed along with one more more test apps
for which agents will be configured and deployed in the lab via the pipeline.
